Dani and Greta's project  
Welcome to Network Adventures!  

**Research question:**  
	â€¢ How does alcohol intake during pregnancy affect children's socio-emotional development longitudinally? - A Network Model of socio-emotional development markers for children with and without prenatal exposure to alcohol  

**Preliminary Hypotheses:**  
	1. Networks become more closely connected over time (global network strength).  
	2. Global network expected influence (EI) increases with time.  
	3. Centrality measures significantly increase with time (strength, closeness, betweenness)  
	4. Modularity (Q index)  will increase with time indicating more non-random node arrangement.  
	5. Temperature changes across time.
