# Background Information of Data Set #

## A longitudinal multi-informant study of psychological adjustment and academic attainment over the transition from primary school to secondary school ##

A short-term UK longitudinal study following children making the transition from primary school to secondary school. Questionnaire data were collected from pupils, parents and teachers on three occasions spaced 6 months apart beginning in the last term of primary school and ending in the last term of the first year of secondary school. Information on attitudes to school and learning (e.g. concerns about transition, school connectedness), pupil psychological adjustment (e.g. Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire), personal characteristics (e.g. self-control), relationships with others (e.g. parent-child relationship quality) and academic attainment (e.g. Key Stage 2 results in English, Maths and Science) were collected.
